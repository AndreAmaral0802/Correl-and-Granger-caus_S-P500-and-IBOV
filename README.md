# Correl-and-Granger-caus_S-P500-and-IBOV

THis project I show that the correlation between the IVVB11 and BOVA11 does exist through a correlation test. In addition, we can see that the IVVB11 does impact
the BOVA11 with 1 day of lag. 


The concepts:
Correlation:

Correlation is a statistical measure that quantifies the degree of association or relationship between two variables. It provides an indication of how changes in one variable are related to changes in another variable. The correlation coefficient, typically represented by the symbol "r," ranges between -1 and 1. A positive correlation indicates a direct relationship, where both variables increase or decrease together. A negative correlation indicates an inverse relationship, where one variable tends to increase as the other decreases. A correlation close to 0 suggests no linear relationship between the variables. However, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation, as other factors or coincidences may be responsible for the observed relationship.

Granger Causality:

Granger causality is a statistical concept used to determine whether one time series variable can be considered as a cause of another time series variable. It extends the notion of correlation by incorporating the element of causality. Granger causality analyzes the predictive power of one variable in explaining the future values of another variable. If Variable A Granger causes Variable B, it means that the past values of Variable A contain information that helps predict the future values of Variable B, beyond what can be predicted using the past values of Variable B alone. Granger causality is typically assessed through statistical tests, such as the Granger causality test, which evaluates the significance of the lagged values of the potential causal variable in predicting the future values of the dependent variable. It provides insights into the direction and strength of the causal relationship between variables in time series analysis.
